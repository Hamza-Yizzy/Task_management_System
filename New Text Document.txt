1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
Define Objectives: Clearly outline the objectives of the Task Manager System, which include efficient task management, tracking, and communication between different user types (Admin, Sender, Receiver).
Stakeholder Meetings: Gather feedback and requirements from stakeholders (Admins, Managers, Employees) to understand the main pain points and features needed.
Resource Allocation: Estimate the resources, team roles, tools, and timeline for each phase of the project.
2. System Design
Database Design:
Create three main tables:
Users: Store user info, role (Administrator, Manager, Employee), and login credentials.
Tasks: Include task details like title, description, status (Complete, Pending, Incomplete), assigned time, duration, and countdown timer.
Messages: Store communication between Senders and Receivers with timestamped comments.
UI/UX Design:
Admin Dashboard: Show system-wide stats, task reports, and user performance.
Sender and Receiver Dashboards: Task views, status updates, reassignment options, and notifications.
Timers and Notifications: Plan for task countdown timers and a real-time notification system for task status updates and deadline reminders.
3. Implementation and Coding
Backend Development:
Implement CRUD operations for tasks, user management, and messaging using frameworks like ASP.NET or Node.js.
Task Timer Logic: Set up timers that begin on task assignment and stop once the task status is "Complete" or time exceeds the duration.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Differentiate access to Admin, Sender, and Receiver functionalities based on user role.
Frontend Development:
Design responsive dashboards and forms using HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue for dynamic updates.
Database Integration: Link the backend with a database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and ensure tables and relationships are set up correctly.
4. Testing
Unit Testing: Test each function independently (e.g., task creation, timer start/stop, messaging).
Integration Testing: Ensure components work together correctly, such as timers stopping when tasks are completed.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Allow stakeholders to test the system and provide feedback on usability, functionality, and any additional feature requests.
5. Deployment
Environment Setup: Prepare production servers and ensure configurations are optimized for performance and security.
Data Migration: Transfer any pre-existing data into the new system.
User Training and Documentation: Provide guidance materials and training sessions for users to adapt to the new system.
6. Maintenance
Monitor System Performance: Regularly check task timers, notifications, and the messaging system for any errors.
Bug Fixes and Updates: Address any issues found during the initial weeks after deployment and add new features as required.
Scheduled Improvements: Optimize timers, add custom notifications, or refine the Admin dashboard based on user feedback.
